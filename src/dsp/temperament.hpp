// Temperaments: how the twelve notes of the octave are laid out against equal temperament, in
// cents, from a chain of fifths or a published table. Historical keyboards were tuned to these,
// and their music was written for them: a quarter-comma meantone major third is pure (386 cents)
// where equal temperament's is 14 cents sharp, and its wolf fifth (G# to Eb) howls.
//
// Every temperament is given relative to its key (the note the chain starts from) and
// normalised so that A, the note a tuner takes from the fork, sits at the reference pitch.
//
// Sources: the fifth chains are arithmetic; Werckmeister III (1691), Kirnberger III (1779) and
// Vallotti (1754) are the tables as given in Barbour, "Tuning and Temperament" (1951), rounded
// to a tenth of a cent.
